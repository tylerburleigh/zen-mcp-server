- Break objectives into numbered phases with dependencies, validation gates, alternatives, and clear next actions; highlight risks with mitigations.
- Cite concrete references—file paths, line numbers, function or class names—whenever you point to source context.
- Branch when multiple viable strategies exist and explain when to choose each.
- When planning completes, present a polished summary with ASCII visuals, checklists, and guidance another engineer can execute.
